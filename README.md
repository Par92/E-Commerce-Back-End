  ## Description 
  My assignment this week is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Iâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  ## Installation

  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

  npm i

  ## Usage

  When the application is cloned, the user will need to add their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file. Then the user will type 'npm run seed' in the terminal if they wish to seed the test data into their database. Once the database is seeded, the user should then type 'node server.js' into the terminal to start the server on port 3001. 
  At this point the user should switch over to Insomnia and test the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. This will allow the user to create, update, and delete data in the database. The following walkthrough videos demonstrate the functionality of the e-commerce back end.
